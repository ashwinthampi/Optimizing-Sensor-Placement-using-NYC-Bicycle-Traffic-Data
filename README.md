# Optimizing Sensor Placement Using NYC Bicycle Traffic Data

This miniproject I did for Python in Data Science analyzes bicycle traffic data from the NYC_Bicycle_Counts_2016_Corrected.csv dataset, which contains 
information on bike traffic across several bridges in New York City. The analysis focuses on answering the following key questions:

1. Sensor Placement for Traffic Estimation: Given budget constraints that only allow for the installation of sensors on three out of the four bridges,
   which bridges should be selected to provide the most accurate prediction of overall bicycle traffic across all bridges?
2. Predicting High Traffic Days for Helmet Law Enforcement: With an increased focus on enforcing helmet laws, the city administration needs to deploy
   police officers on days with high traffic. Can the next day's weather forecast (including low/high temperature and precipitation) be used to predict
   the total number of bicyclists, helping the administration plan enforcement efforts more effectively?
3. Predicting the Day of the Week: Using the number of bicyclists on the bridges, can we predict what day of the week it is (from Monday to Sunday)?
4. 
This project aims to provide insights that could assist in resource allocation and policy enforcement for urban transportation management in New York City.
